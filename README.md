URL Shortener
=============

This is a database driven application called url shortener I made with some online help, for my own use just for practice. It takes the entered urls and shrinks them in order to use less characters but still redirects to the same page that the initial url did if you paste the new one to the browser.  Technologies used: ï»¿PHP, MySQL, JQuery, phpMyAdmin, HTML/CSS, .htaccess rules
